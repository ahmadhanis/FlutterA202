- the backend is run locally using xampp. therefore i added `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` to AndroidManifest.xml to allow HTTP
- To run the program, change the http://192.168.18.4 to whatever your localhost is on the php part php/loadproducts and for the flutter part it's located in models/product.dart on windows use the command `ipconfig` to see the ipvaddress.
